The method to make pizza is as follows :-

First, spread out the pizza dough in a circle. It will become the pizza base.
Then, puff out the corners of the pizza base.
Next, add pizza sauce and then cheese on the pizza base. Spread it out evenly.
Lastly, spread out the toppings evenly on the pizza base.
Set the oven to 150 degree and place the pizza in the oven.
After half an hour later, check the pizza if it is soft and the colour of the crust has turned a little brown.
If it is soft and has changed colour, then remove the pizza out of the oven.
Add a pinch of peppers to add taste.
Give it a name. Example:- PurePizza
Your pizza (PurePizza) is ready.
